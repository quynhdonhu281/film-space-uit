SearchFragment:
    at start (when nothing is being searched): the reclyclerview will be the same as the top rating of the HomeFragment
    when something is being searched (by name): now the reclyclerview will use the viewholder_film.xml to display. The behavior: display item horizontally if the line is full the wrap to the next line
    if can not search anything then show sorry to the user (haven't had xml for this, you can create new one)

FavoriteFragment (plan to change to history movies)
    display all the movies that user had watched

ProfileFragment (Use for setting so maybe use the setting instead)
